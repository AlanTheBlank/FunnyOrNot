# FunnyOrNot
A python script for detecting funny files in the current working directory

# Warning
THIS IS NOT TO BE USED FOR MALICIOUS MEANS
This project is a piss take.  
It doesn't not actually rate files, just deletes them  
I, AlanTheBlank am not responsible for any deleted files!

## Usage
- Put the python script in the folder your want rated
- Run the python script
- Get annoyed because all files in the folder have been deleted
